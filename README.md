# AlgorithmsVisualiser

## Purpose
This project's purpose was to help me understand that how to implement the prominent searching and sorting algorithms and to visualise how do these algorithms handle data in real time.
Futher this project is entended to include colour filling algorithms.

## Features
This project features many algorithms including:

### Sorting Algorithms:
* Bubble sort
* Insertion sort
* Merge sort
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort
* Selection Sort

### Searching Algorithms

#### Elements Searching
* Linear Search
* Binary Search

#### Node Searching
* Dijkstra's Algorithm
* A\ast Algorithm
* Breadth First Search (BFS)
* Depth First Search (DFS)

### Colour Filling Algorithms
* Boundary Fill Algorithm
* Flood Fill Algorithm.


You are able to change the speed at which these algorithms operate as well as the size of the data set.

## Build and Run

* Goto dist folder
* Run Sorting.jar

And play around with it.
